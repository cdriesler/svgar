# Svgar

Svgar is svg for architects and automation: interactive, precise, and performative vector visuals of 3D information. The goal is to enable drawings to *become* interfaces for our tools. Buttons are fine but there are too many. And we design through drawings, not buttons, right?

`v0.4` was completed [Nov 2019](https://github.com/WeWorkSandbox/svgar). While it was useful for relatively static assets, it was clear that work needed to be done to make realtime graphics possible. `v0.5` is exploring the magic .wasm promises and refactoring the api for more intuitive use.
