# Svgar

Svgar is svg for architects and automation: interactive, precise, and performative vector visuals of 3D information. Trying to argue for the web as our collaborative platform. Trying to make drawings come alive.

`v0.4` was completed Nov 2019. While it was successful for static assets, it was clean that some work needed to be done to make realtime graphics possible. `v0.5` is exploring the magic .wasm promises and refactoring the api for more intuitive use.
